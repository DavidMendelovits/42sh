Git Instructions to follow -> everyone will be getting there own branch

DEV branch is where merges will happen.

For now:

git checkout -b <yourbranchname> -> to create and move to your own branch (will inherit files from parent branch)

git commit -m "" -> commit messages are important!

git push --set-upstream origin <yourbranchname> -> to push you work and your branch to github! git push will suffice after initial set-upstream.
  
git branch -> to list all branches
git checkout branch -> switch to another branch to checkout other peoples work (remember to git pull to see most current work)
